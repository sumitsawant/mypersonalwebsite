Everyone seems to be obsessed with it. 'Link your Github' they all say. 'Contribute to repositories to look good in front of employers!''  Well, my first experience with Github was actually a year ago when a friend of mine and I were wanting to create an application for our school. My friend is an experienced full-stack Javascript engineer and I was well, still beginning. He told me to get a Github and I obediently followed, being the clueless-wannabe-hacker. After that, not even one line of code was written for that project and my Github was left unused…until now. 
<br></br>
I'm sure you may have heard about Hackathons by now. Apparently they’re really trendy in the world of computer science. Since I was going to be up in Pennsylvania, I decided to register for PennApps. 
<br></br>
'Give your Github username,' they said. 
<br></br>
FINE. 
<br></br>
I realized it would probably the best time to learn how to use Github since a majority of my summer was going to waste anyway. 
<br></br>
Being the privileged 21st century student, I was easily able to find a useful tutorial on the internet. The video Github Tutorial For Beginners - Github Basics for Mac or Windows and Source Control Basics was easy to follow and I was surprised to see that Github was extremely simple to use (well this is a first.)
<br></br>
Now, there are several videos on the internet that explain Github to beginners. The reason I would suggest this video to everyone is because it teaches completely with respect to command line/terminal which is something the workplace would expect one to know how to be able to use, in comparison to the actual Github application that get's installed on your computer. 
<br></br>
To summarize, I was able to use: 
<br></br>
git clone  (insert clone link here) (lets you copy the git repository aka project, onto your computer)
<br></br>
git add (filename) (lets you add a file that you've added to your folder, into the computer's version of git)
<br></br>
git status (lets you check the changes/new files that git detects on your computer)
<br></br>
git commit -m "asdkjfal" (lets you comment on any changes that you have made in a file or put descriptions e.g adding new files/changing a class etc.)
<br></br>
git push  (lets you push the commit (change) that you made onto the git cloud)
<br></br>
git pull (lets you access another person's changes and pull them onto your laptop)
<br></br>
...on Mac Terminal.  
<br></br>
The parentheses explain what I understood from the video and will hopefully be able to be understood by your average Joe. 
<br></br>
My first project uploaded to Github was actually the front-end of my website that I’ve been working on. You should check it out here! Click on the ReadME to understand how to open it on your browser! 
<br></br>
I'm gloating right now because I finally understood something after a long time. Even though I’m late and behind and several of you are probably shaking your head at how little I know, I consider it a personal achievement and a step toward being able to share cooler and better projects.
<br></br>
Peace out. </p>
